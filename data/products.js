    description:'The Land Rover Defender SUV broadly gets three trim levels – 90, 110, and 130 and further gets many variants, including Standard, S, SE, HSE, X-Dynamic S, X-Dynamic SE, H-Dynamic HSE, First Edition, X, and Carpathian. Under the hood, the BS6 2-updated Land Rover Defender is powered by three petrol and one diesel engine options. The 3.0-litre oil burner churns out 296bhp and 650Nm of peak torque. Meanwhile, the 2.0-litre and 3.0-litre petrol engines produce 296bhp and 400Nm of torque, and 394bhp and 550Nm of torque, respectively. Moreover, the newly introduced variants are powered by a 5.0-litre V8 petrol engine producing 625Nm of torque. The transmission duties are handled by a common eight-speed automatic unit that delivers power to all four wheels through the AWD system. ',

    description: 'The petrol-powered BMW X1 has a 1.5-litre three-cylinder turbocharged petrol engine, which puts out 134bhp and 230Nm. Similar to the oil burner, this one is also paired with a seven-speed dual-clutch transmission sending power to the front wheels only. It has a claimed mileage of 16.35kmpl. The BMW X1 is now larger than before. In fact, it appears as big as the X3 from some angles. There’s a sharper design language, which also makes it look more attractive than before, while the proportions are well-balanced. The new cabin flaunts the floating curved display atop the dashboard. This display also runs the newest interface that BMW first introduced in the flagship 7 Series. The space has also gone up with the larger footprint. Not only is the diesel mill refined and powerful, but it is equally frugal as well. Helped by the mild-hybrid setup and the quick-shifting DCT, the X1 diesel can realistically achieve a mileage of over 20kmpl and a real-world range of over 1000km. ',

    description:'The Mini three-door is powered by a 2.0-litre, four-cylinder petrol engine which generates 189bhp and 280Nm of torque between 1,350-4,600rpm. This engine comes mated to a seven-speed double-clutch Steptronic transmission. The three-door hatchback is capable of sprinting from 0-100kmph in 6.7 seconds. The front of this Mini is expressive and is dominated by the new characteristic hexagonal radiator grille that further enhances the round hallmark Mini LED headlights. The new vertical air intakes are integrated with the bodyworks for better aerodynamics. Further, the fog lights are integrated with LED headlights, whereas the LED side indicators are integrated into the redesigned side scuttles. The sides look fresh too, with striking new contours of wheel arch surrounds. The rear fog light has been integrated into the rear apron as a narrow LED unit. ',

    description:'On the outside, the front fascia is highlighted by the sloping bonnet and a sharp nose. It also gets a new, redesigned front grille with the Mercedes star pattern.

Inside the cabin, the A-Class facelift comes loaded with a dual-screen setup with each screen measuring 10.25 inches – one for the instrument cluster and the other for the touchscreen infotainment unit.

    name: 'Jaguar F-Type',
    image: '/images/aprilia.jpeg',
    description:'The F-Type is available with two powertrains; a 2.0-litre, four-cylinder turbocharged with two outputs - 444bhp/580Nm and 567bhp/700Nm. The more powerful V8 powers the R variants and is exclusively available with an AWD drivetrain. All engines are paired to a ZF-sourced eight-speed automatic transmission. The F-Type loses the feline design penned by Ian Callum for a more generic ‘always angry’ design philosophy. The sleek headlamps, new grille, massive air intakes and air vents on the engine cover are part of the new design theme being adopted by all new Jaguar cars. Apart from some new upholstery and trim materials, the interior design has been left untouched. The most noticeable equipment change is the addition of the 12.3-inch all-digital instrument cluster and the improved touchscreen infotainment system. ',
